# Architecture

## Ownership and data flow

The file service owns canonical location, MIME type, size, checksum, provider, timestamps, and lifecycle state. Consuming applications should persist only `fileId`; selectively cached display metadata is non-authoritative.

Server-mediated flow:

```text
client -> FilesController -> FilesService -> StorageProvider (local or S3)
                                      -> FileMetadataRepository (MongoDB)
```

File bytes should go directly from the client to this service rather than through a BFF and domain service. A BFF or gateway may authorize the request without proxying the multipart body.

Optional short-lived local transfer flow:

```text
admin portal -> BFF -> file service: create scoped authorization
admin portal -> file service -> local provider: transfer using one-time token
```

The BFF keeps its permanent API key. The browser receives a short-lived token whose signed claims carry the trusted `appId`, operation, expiry, and transfer constraints. MongoDB atomically claims the token once and cleans expired replay records with a TTL index.

## Boundaries

- Controllers translate HTTP/Multer values into application-owned inputs and set download headers.
- `FilesService` owns validation orchestration, app scoping, lifecycle rules, and storage/database compensation.
- `FileMetadataRepository` isolates Mongoose and always scopes records by `appId` and `fileId`.
- `StorageProvider` owns provider-specific object operations. Application code never receives an absolute path or SDK response.
- `LocalStorageProvider` is the only filesystem consumer. It creates its root, rejects unsafe keys, and uses collision-safe writes.
- `S3StorageProvider` owns AWS S3 object operations. It uses the same internal keys and rejects unsafe keys before calling AWS.

The exported `FilesService` can be called from a NestJS monolith without HTTP. The controllers provide the standalone microservice API.

## Metadata and consistency

MongoDB `_id` is the Phase 1 public `fileId`. Storage keys are internal and have the form `{appId}/{fileType}/{year}/{month}/{uuid}.{validatedExtension}`.

Storage and MongoDB cannot share a transaction:

- Upload writes storage first and compensates the object if metadata creation fails.
- Bulk upload is best-effort per file.
- Recovery checks object existence before changing metadata.
- Permanent deletion atomically changes `deleted` to `purging`, deletes storage, then deletes metadata. Failed storage deletion restores `deleted`.

## Security model

All queries include `appId` and `fileId`; cross-application access is indistinguishable from a missing file. `x-app-id` identifies the consuming application but does not authenticate it. Normal service requests use API-key or gateway authentication; direct browser routes derive `appId` from the signed transfer token rather than trusting a browser header.

Content is verified using magic bytes, declared MIME comparison, an allowlist, size/count limits, safe filename handling, and opaque keys. See `SECURITY.md` for remaining responsibilities.

## S3 provider

`S3StorageProvider` implements the existing put/read/exists/delete/health contract with AWS PutObject, GetObject, HeadObject, DeleteObject, and bucket readiness operations. Files services, metadata schema, lifecycle behavior, and HTTP endpoints do not change.

The current S3 implementation keeps the existing server-mediated transfer flow. Presigned upload is a separate future workflow and is not enabled by selecting `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`.
